# JavaScript
- you can defined many values inside one variable by square brackets and each value is separated by a comma like that `['hot','cold']`.
# if ststement
if(condition){

    code//it's condition is true

}else{

    code//it's codition is false

}
# switch ststement
switch(variable){

    case 'one'

    code//it's case is true

    break;//if the case is true go out the switch statement

    default

    code//it's all case is false

    break;

}
# for loop
for(variable;codition;update){

    code//that is repeat until the condition equal false

}
# while loop
while(conditon){

    code//you can't go out the loop without condition is false and type the code just one time

}
# do while loop
do{

    code

}while(codition)

- the difference between the while loop and do while loop just the code befor the condition
