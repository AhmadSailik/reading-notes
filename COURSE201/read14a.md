- transforms you can do that by two-dimensional and three-dimensional
- 2D transforms
    - 2D rotate you can do that by add the degree like that `.box-1 {transform: rotate(20deg);} `
    - 2D scale you can do that by add the scale that is appear smaller or larger and you can do that on x and y axises like that
    `.box-2 {transform: scaleY(1.15);}` `.box-3 {transform: scale(.5, 1.15);}`
    - 2D translate that is change the position on x and y axises
    - 2D skew that is change the position to forward and backward
- 3D transforms you can do that on three axises x,y and z
- transitions that is change the state of element, you can add  transitions duration to detect the time of change and you can add transitions time to select the time of doing the change
